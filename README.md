# STL Mirror Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a mirror image of a given STL file in 3D space. The mirror image is generated by projecting the original object onto a 2D plane, normalizing the projection, calculating the distance between the plane and the object, and plotting the mirrored points.

## File Structure

- **stlreader.h** and **stlreader.cpp**: These files contain the implementation of the STL file reader, responsible for parsing the input STL file and generating a triangulation object representing the 3D geometry.

- **stlwriter.h** and **stlwriter.cpp**: These files implement the STL file writer, which writes the mirrored geometry to an output STL file.

- **triangulation.h** and **triangulation.cpp**: These files define the `Triangulation` class, which represents the geometry as a collection of vertices and triangles.

- **mirror.h** and **mirror.cpp**: The `mirror.h` header file contains the declaration of functions for creating the mirror plane, projecting points onto the plane, and calculating mirrored points. The corresponding `mirror.cpp` file provides the implementation of these functions.

## Mirror Algorithm

1. Read the input STL file and parse the geometry into a `Triangulation` object.
2. Generate a mirror plane based on user-defined parameters.
3. Project each vertex of the original object onto the mirror plane.
4. Calculate the mirrored points by reflecting each projected point across the mirror plane.
5. Write the mirrored geometry to an output STL file.

## Output Files

Three text files are generated during the mirror operation:
- **original.txt**: Contains the coordinates of the original vertices.
- **plane.txt**: Contains the coordinates of the points defining the mirror plane.
- **reflection.txt**: Contains the coordinates of the mirrored vertices.

## Plotting

The generated text files can be visualized using GNU Plot or other plotting software to visualize the original object, mirror plane, and mirrored geometry.

## Usage

1. Compile the project using the provided source files.
2. Execute the compiled binary with the path to the input STL file as a command-line argument.
3. The mirrored geometry will be written to an output STL file.

## Dependencies

This project requires GNU Plot or similar software for visualization. Additionally, ensure that the STL file reader and writer functions correctly handle the input and output files.
